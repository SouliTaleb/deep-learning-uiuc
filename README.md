# Deep Learning

> CS598 / IE 534, Fall 2018

**Instructor**: [Justin Sirignano](https://jasirign.github.io/)  
**Teaching Assistants**: Logan Courtney, Raj Kataria, Xiaobo Dong 

> **What is Deep Learning?**
> 
> Deep learning has revolutionized image recognition, speech recognition, and natural language processing. There's also growing interest in applying deep learning to science, engineering, medicine, and finance.
> 
> At a high level, deep neural networks are stacks of nonlinear operations, typically with millions of parameters. This produces a highly flexible and powerful model which has proved effective in many applications. The design of network architectures and optimization methods have been the focus of intense research.


## Course overview

Topics include:

- convolution neural networks
- recurrent neural networks
- deep reinforcement learning

Homeworks on image classification, video recognition, and deep reinforcement learning. Training of deep learning models using TensorFlow and PyTorch. A large amount of GPU resources are provided to the class.

Mathematical analysis of neural networks, reinforcement learning, and stochastic gradient descent algorithms will also be covered in lectures. (However, there will be no proofs in homeworks and the midterm.)

IE 534 Deep Learning is cross-listed with CS 598. This course is part of the Deep Learning sequence:

- IE 398 Deep Learning (undergraduate version)
- IE 534 Deep Learning
- IE 598 Deep Learning II
