# Assignments

- **HW1: Implement and train a neural network from scratch in Python for the MNIST dataset (no PyTorch).** Due September 7 at 5:00 PM.
    - The neural network should be trained on the Training Set using stochastic gradient descent. It should achieve 97-98% accuracy on the Test Set. For full credit, submit via Compass (1) the code and (2) a paragraph (in a PDF document) which states the Test Accuracy and briefly describes the implementation.
- **HW2: Implement and train a convolution neural network from scratch in Python for the MNIST dataset (no PyTorch).** Due September 14 at 5:00 PM.
    - The convolution network should have a single hidden layer with multiple channels.
- **HW3: Implement a deep convolution network with PyTorch for MNIST and CIFAR10.** Due September 21.
- **HW4: Implement a deep residual neural network for CIFAR100. Use data augmentation techniques and dropout.** Due September 28.
- **HW5: Natural Language Processing I.** Due October 5.
- **HW6: Natural Language Processing II.** Due October 12.
- **HW7: Generative adversarial networks (GANs).** 2017 version of this homework. Due October 19.
- **HW8: Video recognition I.** 2017 version of this homework. Due November 2.
- **HW9: Mask RCNN.**
