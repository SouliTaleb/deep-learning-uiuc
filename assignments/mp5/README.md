# HW5: Implement a Deep Learning model for image ranking

> Due October 19 at 5:00 PM.


## Overview

The goal of this project is to introduce you to the computer vision task of image similarity. Like most tasks in this field, it’s been aided by the ability of deep networks to extract image features.

The task of image similarity is retrieve a set of `n` images closest to the query image. One application of this task could involve visual search engine where we provide a query image and want to ﬁnd an image closest that image in the database.

Your task, for this project, will be to implement a simpliﬁed version of the pipeline introduced in “Learning Fine-grained Image Similarity with Deep Ranking”.
