# HW8: Sentiment Analysis for IMDB Movie Reviews

> **Part 3 - Language Model**


This section will be about training a language model by leveraging the additional unlabeled data and showing how this pretraining stage typically leads to better results on other tasks like sentiment analysis.

A language model gives some probability distribution over the words in a sequence. We can essentially feed sequences into a recurrent neural network and train the model to predict the following word. Note that this doesnâ€™t require any additional data labeling. The words themselves are the labels. This means we can utilize all `75000` reviews in the training set.
